## 🎯 The Problem

Picture this: You're scrolling Instagram and find the perfect reel — a gift idea, career advice, travel hack — and you think: *"I'll need this later!"* So you save it. But when that "later" moment comes...

- 🔍 You're searching through the abyss of your saved content
- 😰 You're stressed, swiping endlessly  
- 🤔 Was it a reel? A post? A story?

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The name "InstaHook" draws inspiration from fishing terminology:
- A **reel** doesn't just store line — it draws you in
- What's at the end? A **hook**
- When users save content, they're saying: *"This caught me. I'm hooked."*

InstaHook transforms this metaphor into a smart system that ensures your "catches" don't get away.

## 📖 User Stories

### Matt's Father's Day Success
*"Father's Day was coming up and I had no idea what to get my dad... Then InstaHook popped up a notification with a reel I saved last year — a gift idea I'd totally forgotten about. It was perfect headphones from his favorite brand. Sometimes the best ideas are the ones you already had... you just need the right hook to bring them back."*

### Chloe's Precious Memory
*"When InstaHook surfaced that funny sheep reel again, it didn't just remind me of a video. It reminded me of the last real joy I shared with my mom in the hospital. Thank you, InstaHook, for helping me hold onto that moment."*
